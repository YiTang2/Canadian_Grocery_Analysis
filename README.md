# Canadian Grocery Coffee Products Pricing

## Overview

This paper investigates the factors that influence the current pricing of coffee products in Canadian grocery stores, focusing primarily on historical price data, seasonal trends, and vendor differences. The study uses a Bayesian multiple linear regression model to analyze how these variables affect current prices. The results indicate that historical prices are the strongest predictor of current coffee prices, with significant differences also observed between vendors such as Metro and SaveOnFoods. Seasonal trends show smaller but notable effects. The findings try to inform retail pricing strategies by understanding the impact of past prices, vendor-specific dynamics, and seasonal factors on coffee pricing in the market.
